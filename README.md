# P5 Sketches

A simple wrapper to host experiments using [P5 JS](https://p5js.org/).

Adds some basic quality of life features to the vanilla P5 starter code from [here](https://p5js.org/download/) while keeping its simple no-build approach.
- [x] Intellisense support in VS code by adding the @types/p5 package and a tsconfig.json - from this helpful post - https://fal-works.github.io/p5js-templates/use-ts-in-js.html
- [ ] Helper classes
  - [ ] Mover
  - [ ] Vehicle
  - [ ] Particle
  - [ ] Emitter
  - [ ] Springs
  - [ ] Non-uniform Random helpers (not just normal distributions from the built in randomGaussian)
- And others inspired by Dan Shiffmans [Nature of Code](https://natureofcode.com/) book (and the [2023 edition](https://nature-of-code-2nd-edition.netlify.app/))
